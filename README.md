# Library Management System - Command Line Interface (CLI)
 I developed a Library Management System (LMS) in C# using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, designed as a command-line interface (CLI). This LMS offers both admin and member login options, with a registration process for new members. Admins can add and remove books, monitor availability, and manage the libraryâ€™s collection, while members can register, log in, browse available books, borrow and return books. Real-time updates on availability and robust error handling prevent issues like duplicate borrowing of unavailable items. This project strengthened my skills in C#, .NET and OOP, highlighting the importance of logic handling and user interaction in a CLI-based system.
